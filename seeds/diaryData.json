I watched from the hotdog cart because I'm not allowed to be near them. Anyway diary I'll see you tomorrow. PS, if cats had unibrows they'd unimeow.",

        "description": "Dear diary. How are you? I know you can't feel things, but I think it's polite to ask. Anyways, happy spring. Oh I'm sorry, spring started three days ago. I forgot to let you know. Do diaries know what date it is? I guess not. Most of the girls at school write the dates in their diary entries, probably to let their diaries know. Tammy brings her dairy to school every once in a while. I think she does it so people think she's got secrets to keep.",

      "description": "Dear diary, how are you? I am fine. (sighs) Okay, I'm not fine. You got me. God, you're good. It's just... I'm 13 and never even ridden a horse. I mean, my imaginary horse, Jericho's, great, of course, but I'm ready for the real thing. And I've found just the right place. It's the week-long Hoof Dreams Horse Camp in Montana. You get to participate in a live horse birth. And a sunrise ride to the top of a mountain where a Native American gives you an honorary horse-inspired name. And that at the end, you get to keep the horse. So it's a really great bang for your buck... ing... bronco. Just a little joke. Anyway, I just wish there was some way I could express all this to Mom and Dad. The end.",

I can remember that day clearly, when the rain tickled my nose and the wet moss seeped through my toes. I was thrilled to see so many comets fly across the clear night sky. I made a wish that day, although I had forgetton about. Today reminded me, how little I was in this universe. Fin.",
